"""The adapter that makes the comparison mean anything.

The experiment is: same model, same task, different harness. That only isolates
the harness if every harness is driven through one interface and scored from one
record. The moment a harness gets a bespoke call path, the result measures our
plumbing instead of their scaffold.

So every harness returns the same TaskRun, and the scorers never learn which
harness produced it.
